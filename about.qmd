My name is <strong title="Timothy Wolodzko">Tymoteusz Wołodźko</strong>. I am a machine learning engineer and developer
turned to product role.
I am nerdish about statistics, machine learning, and programming.
Among my other interests is developer productivity, including things like extreme programming, lean, DevOps, and DX.
Privatelly, I read a lot of books, love climbing, and playing the game of Go.
I am also an active user and elected moderator for the [CrossValidated.com](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
statistics and machine learning Q&A site.
