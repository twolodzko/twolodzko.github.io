I recently decided to switch my page from [Jekyll] (GitHub Pages default) to [Quatro]. Both support creating pages
in [Markdown] with configs in YAML, to build static web pages from them. They are simple and quite similar, but
I found Quarto easier to use, has great dev tools, and better documentation. Moreover, Quarto supports $\TeX$
out-of-the-box, without [plug-ins and crazy syntax] like Jekyll.

To create a blog template in Quatro you only need to run **> Quarto: Create Project** and pick "Blog Project" in VS Code,
or use the command

```shell
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

This creates a template to fill in. It has the structure like below

```shell
├── index.qmd
├── posts
│   ├── _metadata.yml
│   └── post.qmd
├── _quarto.yml
└── styles.css
```

The main configuration file is `_quatro.yml`, which can be as simple as below. Here you set the title of the page and the
[theme], which can be further customized using `styles.css`. It can also contain [navbar] and other elements.

```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Title goes here"

format:
  html:
    theme: simplex
    css: styles.css
```

The next important file is `index.qml` which is a QML (YAML/Markdown) template for the main page. For a [blog], it
contains a [listing] or elements to be displayed, like a list of blog posts. It can be a literal list of elements to
include, a directory (e.g. `contents: posts`), a pattern, or a list of patterns. It has many configurations to
customize it.

```yaml
---
listing:
  - id: blog
    contents: posts
    sort: "date desc"
    type: default
    categories: true
    sort-ui: false
    filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: false
---
```

In my case, I decided to show a large list of blog posts mixed with links to other content stored in `external/links.yml`
file, so the `contents` looked like the below.

```yaml
    contents:
      - "posts/*.qmd"
      - "external/links.yml"
```

Finally, the posts are just Markdown files with a metadata header. One nice feature is that you can use `aliases` to
setup [redirects].

```Markdown
---
title: "Title of the post"
date: 2022-12-20
aliases:
  - "/rediect-from-here"
categories: [tag]
---

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed
do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```

When you are ready, run

```shell
quarto preview
```

it will open a live preview for the page, so you can edit it and instantly check the results.

When you're ready, to publish it in [GitHub Pages], you need a create a repository, in **Settings / Pages** define it
as a page, with `gh-pages` as the source branch, and run

```shell
quarto publish gh-pages
```

That's all!
