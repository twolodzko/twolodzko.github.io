# Dependency management

There are [many dependency management tools] for python: conda, poetry, pipenv, tox, etc.
Each of them has its pros and cons, fans and opponents. After spending an awful lot
of time researching them, resolving conflicts in the environments,
duckduckgoing many cryptic errors, I feel that in the long run they are not really worth
it. Currently, my favorite setup is the build-ins: pip + [venv].

The only time when `pip` goes wrong is when you use the wrong `pip`, and for example,
`pip install` a package to a different virtual environment or use `pip` when you
should have used `pip3`. The solution is trivial, just always call `python -m pip`
instead of just `pip`, so that you use the "pip for the python interpreter I'm currently
using". You can also add an `alias pip='python -m pip'` and never worry about it again.

For virtual environments, venv "just works", is lightweight and doesn't need any
additional dependencies, commands, or special formats for the configurations.

To make the [environment variables] consistent, `.env` files are great. `.env`
has a [trivial format]. There are many tools to auto-load the files like
[python-dotenv] and [environs] that can validate the settings as well.

For the best reliability and portability, I use docker.

# Automation

There are many tools for automating repeatable tasks, like running tests, and deployments.
I stick to [Makefiles] and [Bash]. Not that they are the best, but they are the most
widely known and probably pre-installed on your machine. Makefile
has its quirks as it was designed for compiling C code, so projects like
[just] try to skip them by leaving only the good parts, but it's not that
mature yet, so I'm still hesitating.

# Linting and formatting

There are many holy wars about linters and formatters. I don't like wasting time on
discussing formatting during code review, so I like to just [black] everything.
Together with black, I use [isort] that nicely sorts the imports, that has
[black compatibility mode]. My usual pyproject.toml config is something like:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 120
skip-string-normalization = true
target-version = ['py37', 'py38', 'py39']
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | build
  | data
)/
  | python/utils/spark
'''

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 120
```

While I agree that linters are very helpful as an additional code validation layer,
I don't like linters that need overtly complex configuration. For me, [flake8]
is the sweet spot, as it mostly works out-of-the-box. Additionally, flake8
uses [mccabe] to check for code complexity issues. To configure it, I usually
ignore the formatting warnings in setup.cfg, as sometimes they conflict with black.

```ini
[flake8]
max_line_length = 120
max_complexity = 10
ignore =
    # Formatting (fixed by black)
    E1,E2,E3,
    # line too long
    E501,
    # Whitespace warning
    W2,
    # Line break warning
    W5
 ```

# Testing

[Pytest] is currently the gold standard when it comes to testing Python code,
so there is probably no reason to use anything else. That doesn't mean you
should ignore the good old unittest, for example, it has great [unittest.mock]
module. It is worth mentioning that Pytest has many good plugins, for example,
it can run [doctest] tests, and [pytest-cov] produces test coverage reports.
When running it from command-line, there are two useful flags: `-x` for
[failing fast] at the first failed test, and `--ff` for running the tests that
failed at the previous run before other tests, so you immediately know if
you fixed the issue. The whole command then becomes:

```shell
python -m pytest -x --ff -v --color=yes --doctest-modules .
```

By the way, you should also consider [always calling it with] `python -m pytest`.

There are also other code testing tools that I really like but haven't chance
to use yet: [behave] for Behavior Driven Development and [semgrep] that lets
you write custom pattern-based tests for the code.

# Other code issues

There are two more developer tools, that I found useful and I'd like to mention:
[pydeps] finds and visualizes the dependencies between the modules in your code
and is very helpful for tracking the parts of code that are too tightly coupled,
and [vulture] can help with finding dead code.
