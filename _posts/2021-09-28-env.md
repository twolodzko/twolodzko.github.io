Using environment variables for storing configuration is a de facto standard. It
was [one of the recommendations][beyond-12-factor] from Heroku's [Twelve-Factor App][12-factor] guide and has become
widely adopted since then. We are all familiar with environment variables, but there are many, less known, yet nice to
know subtleties.

I would be focusing on [environment variables in Unixes][unix], such as Linux or macOS. Windows is a different story, I
won't be covering it here.

## 1. Environment variables in Linux and macOS

Shell variables are defined using the [following syntax][export]:

```shell
export KEY=value
```

It defines a variable that would be available within the enclosing shell and for all the [subprocesses of the shell]
[subprocess]. You can define [system-wide variables][etc-profile], available for all the users, in the global
/etc/profile config (you need to be root to edit it) or user-specific ~/.profile configurations. Additionally, there are
shell-specific configurations like ~
/.bashrc for [Bash][bash], or ~/.zshrc for ZSH, etc. Unlike ~/.profile, they are used when running a
particular [kind of shell][sh]. Variables are accessed using the `$KEY` or `${KEY}` syntax.

[Variable names][names] can consist of letters, digits, and underscores. By convention, only uppercase letters are
allowed. Names with and without underscores are used, e.g. `LC_CTYPE`, `TMPDIR`, `PYTHONPATH`. To view all the currently
defined environment variables, use the `env` command.

To avoid problems with character encoding non-ASCII data can be encoded using [Base64][base64]. You can use the `base64`
build-in command-line tool or the utilities available for your programming language.

## 2. Command-line usage

To define a shell variable from the command-line you can use the local declaration:

```shell
$ NAME=Joe
$ echo "$NAME"
Joe
```

However, such a variable would not be available for the subprocesses running within the shell. Consider the simple
`hello.py` script:

```python
import os

name = os.environ['NAME']
print(f'Hello {name}!')
```

It will not recognize the local variable:

```shell
$ NAME=Joe
$ python hello.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "hello.py", line 3, in <module>
    name = os.environ['NAME']
  File "[...]/os.py", line 675, in __getitem__
    raise KeyError(key) from None
KeyError: 'NAME'
```

For the variable to be visible within the subprocess, you either need to pass it inline:

```shell
$ NAME=Jenny python hello.py
Hello Jenny!
$ echo "$NAME"
Joe
```

or export it beforehand:

```shell
 $ export NAME=Bob
 $ python hello.py
Hello Bob!
 $ echo "$NAME"
Bob
```

## 3. Passing variables through the SSH connection

Environment variable can [be passed through the SSH connection][ssh]. One use-case for this is that you can take your
local configuration "with you" when connecting to a remote machine, rather than needing to configure it independently.

## 4. Accessing environment variables from the code

Programming languages commonly expose getters and setters for environment variables. In Go, there are `os.Getenv`
and `os.Setenv`, in Python there are `os.getenv` and `os.setenv` functions, as well as the `os.environ`
mapping object that behaves almost as a Python's dict, but reads and writes to environment variables.

When using those functions, keep in mind that your program runs in a subshell, so setting or changing the variable would
affect the subshell, but not the parent shell:

```shell
 $ python
>>> import os
>>> os.environ['NAME']
'Bob'
>>> os.environ['NAME'] = 'Joe'
>>> os.environ['NAME']
'Joe'
>>> exit()
 $ echo "$NAME"
Bob
```

Forgetting this may lead to bugs when trying to pass information between programs via the environment variables. This
won't work, because only the variables within the subshell are modified, rather than the "global"
variables, as shown in the example above.

## 5. The .env files

Another popular solution is the .env files. The files are used for storing project-specific variables and can overwrite
the already available variables. The [format of the .env file][spec] is simple:

```dotenv
NAME=John
SURNAME=Doe
EMAIL=johndoe@example.com
```

It can be loaded directly:

```shell
 $ source .env
 $ python hello.py
Hello John!
```

In many cases, this is won't be needed, as the .env files are being auto-loaded by different software. If you are using
the ZSH shell, the [dotenv plugin][zsh-dotenv] would auto-load a .env file each time you enter a directory containing
it. The same is done by virtual environment management tools such as Python's [Pipenv][pipenv].

There are many solutions for using .env files from code, for example, [python-dotenv][python-dotenv] or the much more
sophisticated [environs][environs] package for Python. Those packages will let you load and parse the .env files to read
the configuration.

Since .env files often store sensitive data such as login credentials, it is a good practice to always keep them in
[.gitignore][gitignore], so as not to accidentally expose them in a git repository.

## 6. Docker containers and cloud apps

Environment variables can be hardcoded for Docker containers using the `ENV key value` instruction in [Dockerfile]
[dockerfile]. Such variables are accessible within the Dockerfile using the `${key}` syntax. They can also be
easily [passed to a container][docker] using the `-e` argument:

```shell
$ docker run -e NAME=Bill debian:stable-slim bash -c 'echo Hi $NAME!'
Hi Bill!
```

Not only Heroku but also Kubernetes, its derivatives, different cloud platforms, and services let you pass environment
variables to the virtual machines, containers, workflows, etc. While this is done differently depending on if you are
using [Kubernetes][k8s], [GitHub Actions][gha], [Jenkins][jenkins], an MLOps platform, or something else, they would
usually allow you to define a list of key-value pairs for the variables in a YAML configuration file. Usually, there
would be two kinds of environment variables: the regular "env" ones and the "secret" variables. Secrets are implemented
differently by different software, but commonly they are stored in encrypted form (but not always, for example, by
default there is nothing secret about [secrets in Kubernetes][k8s-secrets]) and are not directly accessible by the
users. When passed to containers, they behave the same as regular environment variables. All this happens behind the
scenes, but you should be aware of the difference.
